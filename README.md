SOLID Principle: Always use interface

1. Single Responsibility
2. Open for extension and closed for modification - use generic interface and there Implementation classes
3. Liskov substitution - Use multiple interface
4. Interface segregation - Single responsibility for interface
5. Dependency injection - Decoupling classes
